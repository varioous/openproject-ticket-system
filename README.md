# A PHP-Script that turns [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) into a ticket system.
This small PHP script works as follows:
* Called periodically via cronjob
* If new mails are in the Inbox (e.g. support@varioous.at)
  * The script automatically creats a ticket
  * If the user has no account a account is created and invitation mail is sent to user 
  * If the user has no support-project assigned (identifier contains "support") a new project is created. This is needed because otherwise the user would see the support tickets of other projects/user
  * If the user has an account and a support-project, the ticket is created in this support-project
  * A mail to the user is sent with information about the ticket (number, link)
* Slack integration: After ticket creation a slack message is sent to slack channel
* Job integration: For every incoming mail to a job adress an automatic ticket is created in the ticket project inside OpenProject and assigned to the human ressource person
* Reply to ticket (with ticket id in subject): A comment on the ticket is created
